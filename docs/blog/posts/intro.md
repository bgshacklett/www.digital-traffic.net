Hello! Welcome to my new space on the web. I'll be dropping notes here about my
experiences and opinions from my work as a consultant, and as a nerdy
home-owner. After a couple of decades in tech (about half of that on the
industry side), I’ve racked up plenty of stories and developed many opinions
around building and troubleshooting systems and platforms. I figure it's time I
share some of what I’ve learned along the way.

When I’m not heads-down on cloud infrastructure, or obsessing over the latest
software delivery patterns, I spend a lot of my time tinkering with home
automation. Whether it’s getting creative with Home Assistant to make my
life easier (and occasionally more complicated), or DIYing solutions to
avoid overly expensive products, these projects are where I keep my hands dirty
and my curiosity and imagination alive.

This blog (are we still saying that?) is brand new, so expect a mix of content:
deep technical dives, practical project walkthroughs, and plenty of musings on
what works (and what doesn’t). Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just getting
started, I hope this space inspires you to explore, experiment, and maybe even
build something amazing.
